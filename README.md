# VDOM inside Polymer

This is just a proof of concept of putting vdom inside of polymer 1. There is definitely room for improvement. By no means is this a full test of making sure all vue capabilities work inside of polymer 1.

## Getting Started
1. npm install
2. bower install
3. cd vue-page
4. npm install
5. npm run build
6. cd ..
7. npm run dev

## TODO
1. Add React
2. Test out Vue
3. Delete vue import from the end of vue-page/dist/index.html
