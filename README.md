# VDOM inside Polymer

This is just a proof of concept of putting vdom inside of polymer 1. There is definitely room for improvement. By no means is this a full test of making sure all vue capabilities work inside of polymer 1.

## Getting Started
1. npm install
2. bower install
3. npm run react-build
4. npm run vue-build
5. npm run dev

## TODO
1. Bundle entire app
2. Test in IE 11
3. Figure out an easy way to develop ract and vue independently
